> **I am an AI researcher with five years' experience in medical imaging and biosignals at Asan Medical Center**. I have experience with a variety of medical AI projects and have published papers in a broad range of healthcare fields. I also contributed to the practical application of AI by transferring the technology of the two developed algorithms to commercial companies.

My objective is to implement medical diagnosis solutions based on machine learning,
1) lessen the burden on clinicians and improve patients' quality of life.
2) overcome the limitations of inexpensive medical devices or hardware.
